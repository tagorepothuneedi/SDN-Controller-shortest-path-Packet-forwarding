# Simulate-shortest-path-Packet-forwarding
This is a Software defined controller based on open-flow API's which can forward packets on shortest path
Run the Controller script using ryu-manager file_name.py --observe-links
Start the mininet network topology.
Note: The implemention has slow convergence with respect to packet delivery. Needs some time to converge and learn about all the paths and hosts in the network.
